Testing
=======

A goal for Vala 1.0 is to have every tests for every documented feature of the language.

In order to run tests with ``make check`` you must have dbus-glib development files installed, otherwise you will get invalid test failures.

   Expand on this section, explaining how the tests work in the Vala Compiler Repository.
