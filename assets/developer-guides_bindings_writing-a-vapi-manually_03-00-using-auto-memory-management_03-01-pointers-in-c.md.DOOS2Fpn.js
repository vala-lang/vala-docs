The indirection operator means an identifier contains a pointer to a memory location. Usually the data type held in the memory location is also indicated. For example <code>int *identifier</code> means an <code>int</code> is held at the memory location pointed to by <code>identifier</code>. The data type, however, does not have to be specified and instead the &quot;generic&quot; type can be used: <code>void *identifier</code>.</p><p>There can be multiple levels of indirection, e.g. <code>char **identifier</code>.</p><p>The &#39;address of&#39; operator is ampersand, <code>&amp;</code>.</p><p>The use of the indirection operator and the address of operator is relevant to binding function signatures, which is covered in a later section. For a comprehensive explanation of pointers in C see <a href="http://boredzo.org/pointers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">you need to know about pointers in C</a>.</p><p>For now it is enough to understand that the pointer gives no indication of how the memory pointed to is managed. It is not known from seeing a pointer in the C code whether the memory is constant, stack allocated or heap allocated.</p>',6)])])}const u=t(a,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
