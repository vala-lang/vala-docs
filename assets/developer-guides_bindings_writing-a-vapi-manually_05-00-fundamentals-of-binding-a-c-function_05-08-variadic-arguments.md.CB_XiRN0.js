Vala adds a few safeties, but also introduced some new problems.</p><p>One safety put in place is that if the method&#39;s <code>CCode</code> attribute includes <code>sentinel = &quot;X&quot;</code>, then X will always be appended as the last parameter. Since lists are often terminated by a special value, usually null, this can prevent variadic argument overruns.</p><p>Additionally, Vala can do type checking on <code>printf</code>-like and <code>scanf</code>-like function by adding the <code>PrintfFunction</code> or <code>ScanfFunction</code> attributes. However, if the format strings have been modified to include special values, these formatting tokens will not work as intended.</p><p>Return values that append to the end of a function, such as array length returns, and delegate contexts, will often interact badly with variadic arguments, since the Vala compiler will erroneously place the parameter after the &quot;...&quot; in the definition. When dealing with variadic functions, it is best to specify all positions explicitly.</p>',5)])])}const m=a(o,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
