In Vala, a string is a null-terminated list of UTF-8 data that is immutable. If the use case is anything but that, an array of <code>uint8</code> is the preferred way of dealing with that data.</p><p>Frequently, functions take a buffer, fill it with a string and then return the buffer or null (e.g., <code>realpath</code>(3)). The buffer should be a <code>uint8[]</code> and the return value an <code>unowned string?</code>, typically.</p><p>Again, check thoroughly for the ownership of strings being returned. Frequently, the caller does not free the string, especially if it is marked <code>const</code>.</p>',4)])])}const p=a(i,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,p as default};
