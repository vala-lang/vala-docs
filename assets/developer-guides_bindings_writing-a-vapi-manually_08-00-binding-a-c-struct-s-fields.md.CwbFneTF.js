Often, classes will be opaque; that is, there will be no information about the contents of the class. If so, skip this section. When binding fields, first check that there are no getter/setter functions of the same names (see <a href="./06-00-adding-vala-friendly-semantics/06-02-properties.html">Properties</a>). Often times, the details of the structure are in the header, but not intended for public consumption; avoid binding variables that should not be accessed.
