# About Vala

**valac**, the Vala compiler, is a self-hosting compiler that translates
Vala source code into C source and header files. It uses the GObject
type system to create classes and interfaces declared in the Vala source
code.

[The syntax of Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Syntax) is
similar to C#, modified to better fit the GObject type system. Vala
supports modern language features as the following:

-   Interfaces
-   Properties
-   Signals
-   Foreach
-   Lambda expressions
-   Type inference for local variables
-   Generics
-   Non-null types
-   Assisted memory management
-   Exception handling
-   Type modules (Plugins)

Vala is designed to allow access to existing C libraries, especially
GObject-based libraries, without the need for runtime bindings. All that
is needed to use a library with Vala is an API file, containing the
class and method declarations in Vala syntax. Vala currently comes with
bindings for GLib and GTK+ and many others from the GNOME Platform.

Using classes and methods written in Vala from an application written in
C is not difficult. The Vala library only has to install the generated
header files and C applications may then access the GObject-based API of
the Vala library as usual. It should also be easily possible to write a
bindings generator for access to Vala libraries from applications
written in e.g. C# as the Vala parser is written as a library, so that
all compile-time information is available when generating a binding.

## Why Vala?

Many developers want to write GNOME applications and libraries in
high-level programming languages but can't or don't want to use C# or
Java for various reasons, so they are stuck with C without syntax
support for the GObject type system. The Vala compiler allows developers
to write complex object-oriented code rapidly while maintaining a
standard C API and ABI and keeping the memory requirements low.

C# and Java libraries can't be used the same way as native GObject
libraries from C and other languages and can't be accepted as part of
the GNOME Platform. Managed applications also suffer from usually higher
memory requirements which is not acceptable in some situations.

valac produces C source and header files from Vala source files as if
you've written your library or application directly in C. Using a Vala
library from a C application won't look different than using any other
GObject-based library. There won't be a vala runtime library and
applications can distribute the generated C code with their tarballs, so
there are no additional run or build-time dependencies for users.
