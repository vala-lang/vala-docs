# Compiler Guide

The goal of this document is to provide a single point of information
for developers interested in improving Vala.

It is hoped that this document will encourage more Vala users to
contribute to Vala by finding/fixing bugs, writing documentation,
writing test-cases, and implementing new features.

In the opinion of this document's author, a quality Vala 1.0 is an
important part of the future of the GNOME Platform, because it will
simplify the task of creating and maintaining excellent language-neutral
libraries, which are necessary for the next generation of applications.

The Vala code is fresh, and easy to read. The variable and class names
are descriptive, and one often has a general feel of what the code is
supposed to do, so the sparse comments are generally not a problem.
However, because it is a compiler, Vala is inevitably long, and its call
stack deep. This document should provide a high-level view of how Vala
is put together.

This document has been ported from docbook to this wiki in order to be
team-maintained and more up-to-date with latest releases of the Vala
compiler.
