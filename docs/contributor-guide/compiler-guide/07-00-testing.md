# 7. Testing

A goal for Vala 1.0 is to have every tests for every documented feature
of the language.

In order to run tests with `make check` you must have dbus-glib
development files installed, otherwise you will get invalid test
failures.

::: info TODO
Expand on this section, explaining how the tests work in the Vala
Compiler Repository.
