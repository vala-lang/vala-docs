# 1. Prerequisites

To write the binding collect the following:

-   a functional copy of the library with headers
-   the documentation for the library, if such a thing exists
-   the source, if possible
-   examples or tutorials that you can use as tests for your binding

If the library is written in C++, you cannot bind it to Vala unless
there is a separate C binding of the C++ library (e.g., LLVM).

If you are using vim, you may wish to add the following to your .vimrc:

```vim
:noremap <F8> "gyiwO[CCode (cname = "<ESC>"gpa")]<ESC>
```

which allows you to insert an attribute to make it easier to rename a
function by pressing F8 while your cursor is on the symbol.
