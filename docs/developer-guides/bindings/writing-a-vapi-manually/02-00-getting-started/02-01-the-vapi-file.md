# 2.1. The VAPI File

Check if the library's development package has installed a
[pkg-config](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) file
(.pc file extension). If so, give your VAPI file the same name. For
example libfoo.pc should have the VAPI called libfoo.vapi. This allows
the details of the library files to be automatically picked up and
passed through to the C compiler and linker.

When developing a VAPI a typical command to build the tests against the
binding would be:

```shell
valac --vapidir . --pkg libfoo program_using_libfoo.vala
```

The dot after `--vapidir` tells `valac` to include the current directory
when looking for VAPI files. The `--pkg libfoo` switch tells `valac` to
look for a VAPI called `libfoo.vapi`. Note the `.vapi` suffix is
dropped. If the VAPI also has the same name as a `.pc` file then `valac`
will find and use the `.pc` file to extract the relevant library details
to pass to the C compiler and linker.

Example VAPI files can be found in the 
[of the Vala git repository](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vala/tree/master/vapi) of the
Vala git repository. Files stating they have been generated by `vapigen`
have been generated through GObject Introspection and are not examples
of manually written bindings.

Once you have a working VAPI file, even if it is only a subset of the
library's functionality, please consider sharing the file. See 
[Vala Extra VAPIs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vala-extra-vapis) and
[Why Distribute Bindings Upstream](../../upstream-guide).
