# 2.8. Documentation and Valadoc.org

[Valadoc.org](https://valadoc.org) is often the first website a Vala
developer visits when seeking how to use a binding. A new VAPI committed
to [Vala Extra VAPIs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vala-extra-vapis)
can be added to Valadoc.org by adding the VAPI to the 
[list of downloaded packages](https://github.com/Valadoc/valadoc-org/blob/main/documentation/packages.xml)
at Valadoc.org and submitting a pull request to the [Valadoc.org repository](https://github.com/Valadoc/valadoc-org). 
See the[libcolumbus pull request](https://github.com/Valadoc/valadoc-org/pull/39) as an example.

Valadoc.org is frequently re-generated. When Valadoc.org is re-generated
VAPIs are pulled in from `vala-extra-vapis` and documentation generated
from them. If no documentation comments are associated with a VAPI then
Valadoc.org will only show the symbols in the VAPI.

Add a documentation comment before a symbol in the VAPI. A documentation
comment is a C multiline comment with an additional asterisk:

```vala
/**
 * Brief description of class Foo
 *
 * Long description of class Foo, which can include an example
 */
[CCode (cname = "foo", ref_function = "foo_retain", unref_function = "foo_release")]
[Compact]
public class Foo {
    // Details of binding
}
```

The comments can include additional markup. Details are at [Valadoc Comment Markup](https://valadoc.org/markup).

The documentation can be generated locally to test how it will appear.
First, download and build `valadoc`:

```shell
git clone git://git.gnome.org/valadoc
cd valadoc
./autogen.sh
make
make install
```

Second, generate the documentation:

```shell
cd my_binding_directory
valadoc --directory docs --force --package-name mybinding mybinding.vapi
```

This will generate the HTML documentation in the `docs` directory.
`valadoc` expects the `docs` directory to not exist, but `--force`
overrides this. `--package-name mybinding` will create a sub-directory
called `mybinding` in `docs` that contains the generated documentation
for `mybinding.vapi`.

The locally generated documentation will have the same structure as
`valadoc.org`, although the visual styling may differ.
