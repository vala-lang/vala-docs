# 3.1. Pointers in C (or what all these *'s mean)

The asterisk, `*`, is the indirection operator in C. Although, be aware
it is also the multiplication operator. The indirection operator means
an identifier contains a pointer to a memory location. Usually the data
type held in the memory location is also indicated. For example
`int *identifier` means an `int` is held at the memory location pointed
to by `identifier`. The data type, however, does not have to be
specified and instead the "generic" type can be used:
`void *identifier`.

There can be multiple levels of indirection, e.g. `char **identifier`.

The 'address of' operator is ampersand, `&`.

The use of the indirection operator and the address of operator is
relevant to binding function signatures, which is covered in a later
section. For a comprehensive explanation of pointers in C see 
[you need to know about pointers in C](http://boredzo.org/pointers).

For now it is enough to understand that the pointer gives no indication
of how the memory pointed to is managed. It is not known from seeing a
pointer in the C code whether the memory is constant, stack allocated or
heap allocated.
