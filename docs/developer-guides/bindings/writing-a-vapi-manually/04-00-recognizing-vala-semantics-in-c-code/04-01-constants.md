# 4.1. Constants

This sub-section introduces: * the `#define` pre-processor directive in
C * the stages the Vala compiler follows

A constant does not vary during the running of a program and must be a
simple type or string. As an example, if the C library defines a
constant through a `#define` statement:

```c
#define CUSTOM_PI 3.14159265358979323846
```

`#define` is simple text substitution by the pre-processor. So relevant
occurrences of `CUSTOM_PI` are replaced with `3.14159265358979323846` by
the C pre-processor before the C code is then compiled. This is why no
type information is given. Also, because this is done before compilation
it is implicit that the value is constant.

When binding this to Vala the type information and that it is constant
are made explicit:

```vala
public const double CUSTOM_PI;
```

An important point to note is the value is not bound, only the
identifier. Vala will use the identifier in the generated C code and
then the C pre-processor will replace it with the value before
compilation.
