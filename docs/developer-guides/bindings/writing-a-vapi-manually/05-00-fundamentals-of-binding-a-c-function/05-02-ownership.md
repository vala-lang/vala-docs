# 5.2. Ownership

All parameters are, by default, unowned, unless marked with the `owned`
keyword. All return values and `ref` and `out` parameters are, by
default, owned, unless marked with the `unowned` keyword. The basic
types mentioned above have no ownership since they may be copied at
will.

It is often the case that a function will return one of its input
values, particularly when filling a buffer. It is crucial that the
ownership is correct. If not done correctly, Vala will acquire a second
copy of the pointer that it thinks it has to free, and free the same
chunk of memory twice, leaking to a bad time spent in Valgrind.

**If ownership semantics are not correct, either a memory leak has been
written or a double-free has been written.** It is frequently the case
that one needs to read the source to be absolutely sure that ownership
semantics are correct.

Often C programmers will mark return values as const when they are
unowned.
