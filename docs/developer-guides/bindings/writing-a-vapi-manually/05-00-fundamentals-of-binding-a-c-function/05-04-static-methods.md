# 5.4. Static Methods

Enums, flags, simple types, structs and classes can contain functions.
When the Vala compiler generates the C function call the data structure
will be included as the first argument. To prevent the automatic
generation of the argument use the `static` keyword with the function
definition in the VAPI.

Binding static methods is, in fact, simpler than binding member methods,
as there is no instance. Care should be taken to organise static methods
into logical places: some should be in the containing namespace and some
should be in the type definition. In general, methods that produce
instances of the type (i.e., things that act like constructors that
might fail) belong in the type definition.
