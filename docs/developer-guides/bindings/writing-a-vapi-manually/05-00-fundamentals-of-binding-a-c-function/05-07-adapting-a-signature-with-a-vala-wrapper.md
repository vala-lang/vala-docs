# 5.7. Adapting a Signature with a Vala Wrapper

It is possible to adapt an existing function signature by using a
wrapper function written in Vala. This can be used to make the signature
more Vala friendly.

This is usually done by making the C binding `private` and making the
wrapper call the `private` method. The wrapper is also written in the
VAPI file.
