# 7.3. Arrays

Vala arrays are designed to match most of the C array semantics. Since C
arrays, generally, have no explicit length, Vala needs special hints to
know what to do. There are several cases for the length of an array,
discussed below. For a parameter, a `CCode` attribute attached to that
parameter controls the array's binding. For a return value, the `CCode`
attribute **of the method** controls the array's binding.

## 7.3.1. Array Length is Passed as an Argument

By default, Vala assumes the first case and does the following
transformation:

```vala
void foo (double[] array);
double[] foo (float f);
```

```c
void foo(double *array, int array_length);
double *foo(float f, int *array_length);
```

If the C code does this, there are still two potential mismatches: the
order of parameters and the type of the array length. Often, the array
length is a `size_t` or `unsigned int`. The `array_length_pos` can move
the position of the array's length parameter, see
[Changing the Position of Parameters](../05-00-fundamentals-of-binding-a-c-function/05-05-changing-the-position-of-generated-arguments). 
The `array_length_type` specifies a string with the C type
of the array (e.g., `size_t`).

## 7.3.2. Array is Null-Terminated

The `array_null_terminated` will assume the array is null terminated,
like a string is, and set the array length automatically by iterating
over the items in the array. Since Vala always allocates padding in
arrays with the final element as null, passing a Vala-declared array in
does not involve modifying the array in any way.

## 7.3.3. Array Length is a Constant Expression

The `array_length_cexpr` can be set to the C expression that populates
the array's value. It does not have access to the array, the instance
of the object being called, or any other context. It must be a
context-free expression.

## 7.3.4. Array Length is Unknown

If the array length is unknown, setting `array_length = false` in the
`CCode` attribute will cause Vala to set the array's `.length` property
to -1 and not pass the length when used as a parameter.

## 7.3.5. Array Length is Known by Some Awkward Means

This is only applicable for arrays being returned. If the array's
length can be determined, but non-trivially, a wrapper function can be
included that sets the array's `.length property` to the correct value.
