# 7.4. Strings and Buffers

In C, strings and buffers are generally treated like arrays, but Vala
may require slightly more finesse. In Vala, a string is a
null-terminated list of UTF-8 data that is immutable. If the use case is
anything but that, an array of `uint8` is the preferred way of dealing
with that data.

Frequently, functions take a buffer, fill it with a string and then
return the buffer or null (e.g., `realpath`(3)). The buffer should be a
`uint8[]` and the return value an `unowned string?`, typically.

Again, check thoroughly for the ownership of strings being returned.
Frequently, the caller does not free the string, especially if it is
marked `const`.
