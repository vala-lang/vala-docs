# Design Patterns

🎉 Ultra-simplified explanation to design patterns! 🎉

A topic that can easily make anyone's mind wobble. Here I try to make
them stick in to your mind (and maybe mine) by explaining them in the
simplest way possible.

## 🚀 Introduction

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; **guidelines on how
to tackle certain problems**. They are not classes, packages or
libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic
to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain
problems in certain situations.

Wikipedia describes them as

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general
> reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given
> context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be
> transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description
> or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many
> different situations.

## ⚠️ Be Careful

-   Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
-   Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done
    so. Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions **to** problems,
    not solutions **finding** problems; so don't overthink.
-   If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be
    a savior; or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.

> **support for other languages is underway**.
