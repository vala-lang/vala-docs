# Vala FAQ

## Why have you created a whole new programming language? Why didn't you just use C++, C#, D, Java, Python,...?

The type system of GObject doesn't fit perfectly well with the type
system of any existing programming language. Vala is designed for
GObject, this makes it easy to develop GObject-based libraries with Vala
that can be used from a variety of other languages and runtime
environments just like all the other GObject-based libraries out there.
Just like Qt's Meta Object is an extension to C++ to provide signals,
slots, and object properties, Vala is a modification of C# to better
match the GObject type system. We want to use the same syntax as C#
wherever it makes sense to keep the entry barrier low.

## How can I use Vala libraries from C, C++, C#, D, Java, Python,...?

You can always use Vala libraries just like they were GObject/C
libraries, they provide C header files and use GObject for all classes.
In contrast to C, Vala generates [GObjectIntrospection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
metadata for you so you do not need to care about binding your libraries
to any language for which gobject-introspection 
[support exists](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GObjectIntrospection/Users).

## How does the performance of Vala applications compare to other applications?

The performance should be pretty similar to GObject/C-based code as
there is no Vala-specific runtime library/environment that needs to be
loaded. The C compiler can also apply the same optimizations on
Vala-generated C code and plain GObject/C code. The Vala compiler uses
reference counting in more places than most GObject/C-based applications
do. However, Vala allows to fine-tune that easily in
performance-critical sections with the `weak` modifier.

## Vala is quite similar to C#. Do you plan to replace Mono?

Vala wants to be a convenient tool for creating libraries which can be
consumed by any programming language supported by the GNOME platform -
including Mono. Vala tries to integrate, not to separate.

## What does "string? foo" mean?

The ?-modifier tells the vala compiler that a passed or returned value
may be `null`.

## Can I use keywords as identifiers?

Yes, if you prepend the identifier with an `@`.

## Why do I have to inherit from GObject?

Since Vala is based on GObject it's needed to inherit almost every
class from GObject. However, it's not mandatory, but if you don't
inherit, you will only get a very restricted class. Unless you know what
you're doing you want to inherit from GObject. The ../BasicSample shows
how to achieve a full-featured class.

## Can I use pointer arithmetic inside strings?

If I write this, I get an error:

```vala
string a = "baer";
a[1] = 'e';
stdout.printf ("%sn", a);
```

A vala string is a `char*` if I look at the C version. Why isn't it
allowed, and what is the solution?

One reason why it's not allowed is that Vala strings are encoded in
UTF-8, which uses a variable number of bytes per character. This means
that replacing a single character as in your example might require
resizing the string, which we don't want to happen implicitly.

There are two possibilities how to modify strings in Vala. The
recommended way is to use the GLib.!StringBuilder class, which is a
binding for GString. The other possibility is to use raw pointers just
like in C, however, you have to care about encoding and memory
management yourself, then.

```vala
char* str_ptr = new char[64];
str_ptr[0] = 'e';
string str = (string) str_ptr;
delete str_ptr;
```

## How to test if an object is some class or subclass?

Use the "`is`" operator.

```vala
var wi = Gtk.Button();
if (wi is Gtk.Widget)
    stdout.printf("Is a Widget.n");
if (wi is Gtk.Button)
    stdout.printf("Is a Button.n");
```

Works with interfaces too.

## How to force cast an object from one type to another type?

Use "`(Klass) object`".

```vala
Gtk.Button btn1 = (Gtk.Button) awidget;
```

## Does Vala have a preprocessor?

Starting with version 0.7.0, Vala supports the preprocessing directives
`#if`, `#elif`, `#else`, and `#endif`. The supported operators for
conditionals are `==`, `!`, `&&` and `||`. There is no intention to ever
support macros as found in the C preprocessor.

```vala
int main (string[] args) {
#if COND
  message ("COND IS DEFINED");
#else
  message ("COND IS NOT DEFINED");
#endif
  return 0;
}
```

You must add `-D COND` to the valac command line to enable conditional
compilation for the above example.

For more details see [Preprocessor - Vala Reference
Manual](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/vala/manual/preprocessor.html).

## What does [SimpleType] and [Compact] in bindings mean?

Have a look at this graphic:

![Vala SimpleType and Compact explanation diagram](assets/vala-structs-classes.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Structs are always shallow copied before they are passed to C
functions. The difference with `[SimpleType]` is only at the C
implementation, semantics in Vala don't change. This might not be very
clear in the image above.

> [!NOTE]
> Only GObject classes have gobject properties (introspectable at runtime). 
This feature is not emphasized in the above image.


## How do I read from stdin?

Allocating space for strings to be read in can be tricky. See 
[Input Samples](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/InputSamples) for an example.

## How do I get the GType for something?

Try the `typeof` operator. Fx `typeof(string)` is a `G_TYPE_STRING`.

## Why do static members not get initialized?

There's currently [a bug](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=543189) about that.
Unfortunately, due to C limitations and a missing coherent design for
that, it's hard to implement.

You can work around this with a dummy instantiation before first access
to a static class member:

```vala
class Statico : Object {

    public static int test_value;

    static construct {
        test_value = 5;
    }
}

void main () {
    new Statico ();   // dummy instantiation
    stdout.printf ("%dn", Statico.test_value);
}
```

## Why can't I chain up to base constructor?

Often external libraries do not offer functionality for `base()` usage.
Therefore you have to use GObject-based construction using
`Object(prop1: value1, ...)`. As an example:

```vala
// https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/InputSamples
class MyWindow : Gtk.Window
  public MyWindow () {
    Object (type: Gtk.WindowType.TOPLEVEL);
  }
}
```

## How do I convert from uint8[] (or char[]) to string and viceversa?

From uint8[] (or what else) to string it's as simple as casting to
string: `(string) array`. From string to uint8[] array it's about
accessing the data member: `yourstr.data`.

If the uint8[] array doesn't have a terminating 0 byte at the end,
you must append one before converting to a string. Note that
`yourstr.data` will give you an array without the terminating 0 byte, so
`(string) yourstr.data == yourstr` is incorrect.

## How do I create an array of structs?

First of all, take a look to the ways structs can be created at
[Structs](tutorials/programming-language/main/02-00-basics/02-07-language-elements#_2-7-5-structs).

If the array is constant:

```vala
const YourStruct[] s = { { value1, value2, ... }, ...};
```

Otherwise:

```vala
YourStruct[] s = { YourStruct() { field1=value1, field2=value2, ... }, ...};
```

Alternatively, if you are the author of YourStruct (that is not
external) you can provide a constructor to simplify the above
expression:

```vala
public struct YourStruct {
  public int field1;
  public string field2;
  ...
  public YourStruct (int field1, string field2, ...) {
    this.field1 = field1;
    this.field2 = field2;
    ...
  }
}
```

Then you can create the array like this:

```vala
YourStruct[] s = { YourStruct (field1, field2, ...), ...};
```

## How do I pass user data for a callback?

Vala automatically passes user data to callbacks depending on the
context. There are mainly two techniques for passing a callback. The
first is by passing an instance method:

```vala
the_method (some_instance.some_method);
```

In this case Vala will automatically pass some_instance as user data, so
that when some_method is called "this" exists in the method scope.

The other way to provide custom user data is to use closures:

```vala
var some_var = ...;
the_method (() => { use some_var });
```

Vala automatically creates the user data with all the variables captured
by the closure, so that they exist at the time when the callback is
called.

## I have a config.vapi binding for config.h, but it is not the first file included

Vala doesn't know that your binding should be included first. However,
you can tell your C compiler to include arbitrary files first by using
`-include config.h` argument. With vala, you could use `vala -X
-include config.h` to pass this argument to the C compiler.

## How can I fix CC warnings?

Unfortunately you can't usually, and you can ignore CC warnings safely
most of the time. You only want to look for Vala warnings usually.

## Why don't you use .typelib instead of .gir?

Because the .gir file contains some information that gets stripped in
.typelib files.

## Why should I use .vapi instead of .gir with --pkg?

The .gir files are produced by libraries, while the .vapi are produced
with `vapigen` using the .gir plus metadata files. These are the reasons
why vala developers highly suggest using the .vapi instead of the .gir:

1.  Parsing .gir files is way slower because the gir parser is not much
    optimized. The .vapi representation is vala code thus it doesn't
    need particular processing compared to the .gir. Remember that .gir
    is a different language that needs to be transformed into vala.
2.  Parsing a .gir file does also involve parsing the dependant .gir
    files, which means having the necessary metadata for all the .gir
    files, which neither vala nor libraries distribute (not yet).
3.  With a .vapi file you have a human readable representation of how
    vapigen interprets the .gir file plus metadata. So it serves as
    documentation for yourself, instead of going wild guessing the name
    of the symbols or whatelse.
4.  You can easily compare two .vapi files for differences because a
    symbol is usually defined on one line, while with .gir a single
    symbol is defined on multiple lines.
5.  A .gir file is heavy weight whereas the .vapi file is very light
    weight, which means it's suitable for being copied locally in your
    project. For example, Gtk-3.0.gir is 5 MB while gkt+-3.0.vapi is 0.4
    MB.

## Is having a local copy of a .vapi in my project good practice?

It isn't inherently good or bad. There are some advantages,
disadvantages, and trade-offs to having a local copy of the VAPI
embedded in your codebase. The issue is quite similar to the question of
whether to include a copy of libraries you depend on in your code tree,
or link to a system-wide version.

Perhaps the most significant advantage is that it is possible that the
"upgraded" bindings will include a backwards-incompatible change which
can break your project. Such changes were common when Vala was younger
but these days such changes are exceedingly rare, particularly for
bindings distributed with Vala or generated from GObject Introspection
repositories.

Probably the biggest disadvantage is that you will not automatically
benefit from backwards-compatible fixes and improvements that happen in
bindings over time. It is quite common for updated bindings to fix bugs
(most prominently memory leaks), and if you use a local copy of the
binding you will not benefit from such changes until you update the copy
of the bindings your software uses.

Of course, sometimes it isn't really feasible to depend on the
system-wide binding because there isn't one installed. While we
generally prefer for Vala bindings to be distributed with the project
they bind, or with Vala itself for some popular libraries, third-party
bindings generally aren't installed system-wide and including a local
copy is considered the preferred method of use. For example, the
[vala-extra-vapis](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vala-extra-vapis)
repository (which contains many third-party bindings) is intended to be
usable as a git submodule or subtree.

One more thing to consider is that using a local copy of bindings can
make [https://valadoc.org](https://valadoc.org) less useful. Typically, valadoc.org content
tracks the latest stable version, if you're using a current Linux
distribution, is likely the same version you have on your system. If you
make a local copy of the bindings you use they will often be older
versions which don't match what [valadoc.org](https://valadoc.org)
says.
