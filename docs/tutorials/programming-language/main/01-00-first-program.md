# 1. First Program

## 1.1. Your First Program

Sadly predictable, but still:

```vala
class Demo.HelloWorld : GLib.Object {
    public static int main(string[] args) {
        stdout.printf("Hello, World\n");
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Of course, that is a Vala *Hello World* program. I expect you can
recognise some parts of it well enough, but just to be thorough I shall
go through it step by step.

```vala
class Demo.HelloWorld : GLib.Object { 
    //... 
}
```

This line identifies the beginning of a class definition. Classes in
Vala are very similar in concept to other languages. A class is
basically a type of object, of which instances can be created, all
having the same properties. The implementation of classed types is taken
care of by the *gobject* library, but details of this are not important
for general usage.

What is important to note is that this class is specifically described
as being a subclass of *GLib.Object*. This is because Vala allows other
types of class, but in most cases, this is the sort that you want. In
fact, some language features of Vala are only allowed if your class is
descended from GLib's *Object*.

Other parts of this line show namespacing and fully qualified names,
although these will be explained later.

```vala
public static int main(string[] args) {
    //...
}
```

This is the start of a method definition. A method is a function related
to a type of object that can be executed on an object of that type. The
static method means that the method can be called without possessing a
particular instance of the type. The fact that this method is called
`main` and has the signature it does means that Vala will recognise it
as the entry point for the program.

The *main* method doesn't have to be defined inside a class. However,
if it is defined inside a class it must be `static`. It doesn't matter
if it's `public` or `private`. The return type may be either `int` or
`void`. With a `void` return type the program will implicitly terminate
with exit code 0. The string array parameter holding the command line
arguments is optional.

```vala
stdout.printf("Hello, World\n");
```

*stdout* is an object in the *GLib* namespace that Vala ensures you have
access to whenever required. This line instructs Vala to execute the
method called *printf* of the *stdout* object, with the hello string as
an argument. In Vala, this is always the syntax you use to call a method
on an object, or to access an object's data. `\n` is the escape
sequence for a new line.

```vala
return 0;
```

`return` is to return a value to the caller and terminate the execution
of the *main* method which also terminates the execution of the program.
The returned value of the *main* method is then taken as the exit code
of the program.

The last lines simply end the definitions of the method and class.

## 1.2. Compile and Run

Assuming you have Vala installed, then all it takes to compile and
execute this program is:

```shell
valac hello.vala
./hello
```

*valac* is the Vala compiler, which will compile your Vala code into a
binary. The resulting binary will have the same name as the source file
and can then be directly executed on the machine. You can probably guess
the output.

If you get some warnings from a C language compiler, please jump to
[valac](07-00-tools/07-01-valac) for the reason
and solution.

## 1.3. Running as a Script

On Unix-like operating systems, you can also run a Vala source file directly as a script. 
This is achieved by adding a 'shebang' line at the very beginning of the file. 
For example, you could save the "Hello, World" program as `hello.vala` with the following content:

```vala
#!/usr/bin/env vala // [!code warning]
class Demo.HelloWorld : GLib.Object {
    public static int main(string[] args) {
        stdout.printf("Hello, World\n");
        return 0;
    }
}
```
The first line, `#!/usr/bin/env vala`, is the shebang. It tells the system to use the `vala` command to execute this file.

Before running it, you need to grant the file executable permissions:

```shell
chmod +x hello.vala
```

Now you can run it directly from your terminal:

```shell
./hello.vala
```

This will produce the same "Hello, World" output. Behind the scenes, the system invokes the Vala compiler to compile the source code into a temporary binary file, and then executes that binary.
