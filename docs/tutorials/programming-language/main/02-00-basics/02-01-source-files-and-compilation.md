# 2.1. Source Files and Compilation

Vala code is written in files with *.vala* extensions. Vala does not
enforce as much structure as a language like Java - there are no
concepts of packages or class files in the same way. Instead structure
is defined by text inside each file, describing the logical location of
the code with constructs such as namespaces. When you want to compile
Vala code, you give the compiler a list of the files required, and Vala
will work out how they fit together.

The upshot of all this is that you can put as many classes or functions
into a file as you want, even combining parts of different namespaces in
together. This is not necessarily a good idea. There are certain
conventions you probably want to follow. A good example of how to
structure a project in Vala is the Vala project itself.

All source files for the same package are supplied as command line
parameters to the Vala compiler `valac`, along with compiler flags. This
works similarly to how Java source code is compiled. For example:

```shell
valac compiler.vala --pkg libvala
```

will produce a binary with the name *compiler* that links with the
package `libvala`. In fact, this is how the *valac* compiler is
produced!

If you want the binary to have a different name or if you have passed
multiple source files to the compiler you can specify the binary name
explicitly with the `-o` switch:

```shell
valac source1.vala source2.vala -o myprogram
./myprogram
```

If you give *valac* the `-C` switch, it won't compile your program into
a binary file. Instead it will output the intermediate C code for each
of your Vala source files into a corresponding C source file, in this
case *source1.c* and *source2.c*. If you look at the content of these
files you can see that programming a class in Vala is equivalent to the
same task in C, but a whole lot more succinct. You will also notice that
this class is registered dynamically in the running system. This is a
good example of the power of the GNOME platform, but as I've said
before, you do not need to know much about this to use Vala.

If you want to have a C header file for your project you can use the
`-H` switch:

```shell
valac hello.vala -C -H hello.h
```
