# 2.3. Comments

Vala allows comments in code in different ways.

```vala
// Comment continues until end of line

/* Comment lasts between delimiters */

/**
 * Documentation comment
 */
```

These are handled in the same way as in most other languages and so need
little explanation.

Documentation comments are not special to the Vala compiler, but a
documentation generation tool like
[Valadoc](../../../../developer-guides/documentation/valadoc-guide) will recognise them.
