# 2.8. Code Attributes

Code attributes instruct the Vala compiler details about how the code is
supposed to work on the target platform. Their syntax is
`[AttributeName]` or
`[AttributeName(param1 = value1, param2 = value2, ...)]`.

They are mostly used for bindings in *vapi* files, `[CCode(...)]` being
the most prominent attribute here. Another example is the `[DBus(...)]`
attribute for exporting remote interfaces via
[D-Bus](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus).
