# 3.2. Construction

Vala supports two slightly different construction schemes: the
Java/C#-style construction scheme which we will focus on for now, and
the GObject-style construction scheme which will be described in a
section at the end of the chapter.

Vala does not support constructor overloading for the same reasons that
method overloading is not allowed, which means a class may not have
multiple constructors with the same name. However, this is no problem
because Vala supports *named constructors*. If you want to offer
multiple constructors you may give them different name additions:

```vala
public class Button : Object {

    public Button() {
    }

    public Button.with_label(string label) {
    }

    public Button.from_stock(string stock_id) {
    }
}
```

Instantiation is analogous:

```vala
new Button();
new Button.with_label("Click me");
new Button.from_stock(Gtk.STOCK_OK);
```

You may chain constructors via `this()` or `this.{name_extension}()`:

```vala
public class Point : Object {
    public double x;
    public double y;

    public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public Point.rectangular(double x, double y) {
        this(x, y);
    }

    public Point.polar(double radius, double angle) {
        this.rectangular(radius * Math.cos(angle), radius * Math.sin(angle));
    }
}

void main() {
    var p1 = new Point.rectangular(5.7, 1.2);
    var p2 = new Point.polar(5.7, 1.2);
}
```
