# 3.8. Interfaces

A class in Vala may implement any number of interfaces. Each interface
is a type, much like a class, but one that cannot be instantiated. By
"implementing" one or more interfaces, a class may declare that its
instances are also instances of the interface, and therefore may be used
in any situation where an instance of that interface is expected.

The procedure for implementing an interface is the same as for
inheriting from classes with abstract methods in - if the class is to be
useful it must provide implementations for all methods that are
described but not yet implemented.

A simple interface definition looks like:

```vala
public interface ITest : GLib.Object {
    public abstract int data_1 { get; set; }
    public abstract void method_1();
}
```

This code describes an interface "`ITest`" which requires GLib.Object
as parent of the implementor class and contains two members. "data_1"
is a property, as described above, except that it is declared
`abstract`. Vala will therefore not implement this property, but instead
require that classes implementing this interface have a property called
"data_1" that has both `get` and `set` accessors - it is required that
this be `abstract` as an interface may not have any data members. The
second member "method_1" is a method. Here it is declared that this
method must be implemented by classes that implement this interface.

The simplest possible full implementation of this interface is:

```vala
public class Test1 : GLib.Object, ITest {
    public int data_1 { get; set; }
    public void method_1() {
    }
}
```

And may be used as follows:

```vala
var t = new Test1();
t.method_1();

ITest i = t;
i.method_1();
```

## 3.8.1. Defining Prerequisites

Interfaces in Vala may not inherit from other interfaces, but they may
declare other interfaces to be prerequisites, which works in roughly the
same way. For example, it may be desirable to say that any class that
implements a `List` interface must also implement a `Collection` and
`Traversable` interfaces. The syntax for this is exactly the same as for
describing interface implementation in classes:

```vala
public interface List : Collection, Traversable {
}
```

This definition of "List" may not be implemented in a class without
"Collection" also being implemented, and so Vala enforces the
following style of declaration for a class wishing to implement
"List", where all implemented interfaces must be described:

```vala
public class ListClass : GLib.Object, Collection, List {
}
```

Vala interfaces may also have a class as a prerequisite. If a class name
is given in the list of prerequisites, the interface may only be
implemented in classes that derive from that prerequisite class. This is
often used to ensure that an instance of an interface is also a
GLib.Object subclass, and so the interface can be used, for example, as
the type of a property.

The fact that interfaces can not inherit from other interfaces is mostly
only a technical distinction - in practice Vala's system works the same
as other languages in this area, but with the extra feature of
prerequisite classes.

## 3.8.2. Defining default implementation in methods

There's another important difference between Vala interfaces and
Java/C# interfaces: Vala interfaces may have non-abstract methods.

Vala actually allows method implementations in interfaces, then a method
with a default implementation must be declared as `virtual`. Due to this
fact Vala interfaces can act as
[mixins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixins). This is a restricted
form of multiple inheritance.

```vala
public interface Callable : GLib.Object {
   public abstract bool answering { get; protected set; }
   public abstract void answer ();
   public virtual bool hang ()
   {
      answering = false;
      return true;
   }
}
```

Interface `Callable` defines an abstract property called `answering`,
where any class implementing this interface can monitor the state of a
call, details about `answer` a call is a mautter of the implementator,
but `hang` defines a default implementation to set `answering` to false
when hanging a call.

```vala
public class Phone : GLib.Object, Callable {
   public bool answering { get; protected set; }
   public void answer ()
   {
     /* answer code implementation */
   }

   public static void main ()
   {
      var f = new Phone ();
      if (f.hang ())
         stdout.printf("Hand done.\n");
      else
         stdout.printf("Hand Error!\n");
      stdout.printf("END\n");
   }
}
```

When compiling and running, you will find that `Phone` class actually no
implements `Callable.hang()` method, but it is able to use it, then the
result is a message `Hang done.`

```vala
public class TechPhone : GLib.Object, Callable
{
   public bool answering { get; protected set; }
   public void answer ()
   {
     /* answer code implementation */
   }

   public bool hang ()
   {
      answering = false;
      stdout.printf ("TechPhone.hang () implementation!");
      return false;
   }
}
```

In this case `TechPhone` is another implementation to `Callable`, then
when `hang()` method is called on an instance of `TechPhone` it will
always return `false` and print the message
`TechPhone.hang () implementation!`, hidding completelly
`Callable.hang()` default implementation.

## 3.8.3. Properties

An interface can define properties that must be implemented for classes.
Implementator class must define a property with the same signature and
access permissions to the property's `get` and `set`.

As any GObject property, you can define a body to property's `set` and
`get` in the implementator class, when no body is used values are set
and get by default. If given, you must define a `private` field to store
the properties values to be used outside or inside the class.

`Callable` interface definition, defines an `answering` property. In
this case this interface defines a `answering` with a `protected set`,
allowing a read only property for any object using an instance of
`Callable`, but allows class implementors to write values to it, like
`TechPhone` class does when implements `hang()` method.

## 3.8.4. Mixins and Multiple Inheritance

As described above, Vala while it is backed by C and GObject, can
provide a limited multiple inheritance mechanism, by adding virtual
methods to Interfaces. Is possible to add some ways to define default
method implementations in interface implementor class and allow derived
classes to override that methods.

If you define a `virtual` method in an interface and implement it in a
class, you can't override interface's method without leaving derived
classes unable to access to interface default one. Consider following
code:

```vala
public interface Callable : GLib.Object {
   public abstract bool answering { get; protected set; }
   public abstract void answer ();
   public abstract bool hang ();
   public static bool default_hang (Callable call)
   {
      stdout.printf ("At Callable.hang()\n");
      call.answering = false;
      return true;
   }
}

public abstract class Caller : GLib.Object, Callable
{
   public bool answering { get; protected set; }
   public void answer ()
   {
     stdout.printf ("At Caller.answer()\n");
     answering = true;
     hang ();
   }
   public virtual bool hang () { return Callable.default_hang (this); }
}

public class TechPhone : Caller {
    public string number { get; set; }
}

public class Phone : Caller {
   public override bool hang () {
   stdout.printf ("At Phone.hang()\n");
   return false;
}

   public static void main ()
   {
      var f = (Callable) new Phone ();
      f.answer ();
      if (f.hang ())
         stdout.printf("Hand done.\n");
      else
         stdout.printf("Hand Error!\n");

      var t = (Callable) new TechPhone ();
      t.answer ();
      if (t.hang ())
         stdout.printf("Tech Hand done.\n");
      else
         stdout.printf("Tech Hand Error!\n");
      stdout.printf("END\n");
   }
}
```

In this case, we have defined a `Callable` interface with a default
implementation for `abstract bool hang ()` called `default_hang`, it
could be a `static` or `virtual` method. Then `Caller` is a base class
implementing `Callable` for the `TechPhone` and `Phone` classes, while
`Caller`'s `hang ()` method simple call `Callable` default
implementation. `TechPhone` doesn't do anything and just takes `Caller`
as base class, using the default method implementations; but `Phone`
overrides `Caller.hang ()` and this makes to use its own implementation,
allowing to always call it even if it is cast to `Callable` object.

### 3.8.4.1. Explicit method implementation

The explicit interface method implementation allows to implement two
interfaces that have methods (not properties) with the same name.
Example:

```vala
interface Foo {
   public abstract int m();
}

interface Bar {
   public abstract string m();
}

class Cls: Foo, Bar {
   public int Foo.m() {
      return 10;
   }

   public string Bar.m() {
      sreturn "bar";
   }
}

void main () {
   var cls = new Cls ();
   message ("%d %s", ((Foo) cls).m(), ((Bar) cls).m());
}
```

Will output 10 bar.
