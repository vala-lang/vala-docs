# 4.7. The Main Loop

GLib includes a system for running an event loop, in the classes around
`MainLoop`. The purpose of this system is to allow you to write a
program that waits for events and responds to them, instead of having to
constantly check conditions. This is the model that GTK+ uses, so that a
program can wait for user interaction without having to have any
currently running code.

The following program creates and starts a `MainLoop`, and then attaches
a source of events to it. In this case the source is a simple timer,
that will execute the given method after 2000ms. The method will in fact
just stop the main loop, which will in this case exit the program.

```vala
void main() {

    var loop = new MainLoop();
    var time = new TimeoutSource(2000);

    time.set_callback(() => {
        stdout.printf("Time!\n");
        loop.quit();
        return false;
    });

    time.attach(loop.get_context());

    loop.run();
}
```

When using GTK+, a main loop will be created automatically, and will be
started when you call the `Gtk.main()` method. This marks the point
where the program is ready to run and start accepting events from the
user or elsewhere. The code in GTK+ is equivalent to the short example
above, and so you may add event sources in much the same way, although
of course you need to use the GTK+ methods to control the main loop.

```vala
void main(string[] args) {

    Gtk.init(ref args);
    var time = new TimeoutSource(2000);

    time.set_callback(() => {
        stdout.printf("Time!\n");
        Gtk.main_quit();
        return false;
    });

    time.attach(null);

    Gtk.main();
}
```

A common requirement in GUI programs is to execute some code as soon as
possible, but only when it will not disturb the user. For this, you use
`IdleSource` instances. These send events to the programs main loop, but
request they only be dealt with when there is nothing more important to
do.
