# 4.9. Weak References

Vala's memory management is based on automatic reference counting. Each
time an object is assigned to a variable its internal reference count is
increased by 1, each time a variable referencing an object goes out of
scope its internal reference count is decreased by 1. If the reference
count reaches 0 the object will be freed.

However, it is possible to form a reference cycle with your data
structures. For example, with a tree data structure where a child node
holds a reference to its parent and vice versa, or a doubly-linked list
where each element holds a reference to its predecessor and the
predecessor holds a reference to its successor.

In these cases objects could keep themselves alive simply by referencing
to each other, even though they should be freed. To break such a
reference cycle you can use the `weak` modifier for one of the
references:

```vala
class Node {
    public weak Node prev;
    public Node next;
}
```
