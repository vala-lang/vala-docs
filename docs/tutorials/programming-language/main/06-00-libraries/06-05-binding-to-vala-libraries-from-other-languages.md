# 6.5. Binding to Vala Libraries from Other Languages

Vala produces C code and also produces C headers. Binding from C is
relatively easy, although the library may make use of a lot of GObject
boiler plate code.

For Vala based projects, using either the Vala or Genie syntax, a VAPI
can be produced that makes bindings easy.

The Vala compiler can also produce a GObject Introspection Repository
(GIR) file. This makes bindings from languages that support GObject
Introspection very easy. Often the binding is at runtime so a typelib
file also needs to be produced and libgirepository and libffi are used
at runtime for the binding.

## 6.5.1. Haskell

As of January 2017 the Haskell generator from GObject introspection
repositories, haskell-gi, is described as complete. The Haskell wiki
page on GObject Introspection advises "The Haskell code generator at
haskell-gi is now essentially complete: all the information exposed in
the bindings should now be available from the autogenerated bindings.
This includes: ordinary functions, signals, virtual functions, structure
fields, object properties, etc."

Haskell bindings for GObject-Introspection capable libraries

## 6.5.2. JavaScript

[node-gtk](https://github.com/romgrk/node-gtk) - "uses the GObject
Introspection library (as PyGObject, for example), so any
gobject-introspectable library is supported"

[node-gir](https://github.com/creationix/node-gir) - "Node-gir is
Node.js bindings to GObject Introspection making it possible to make
automatic and dynamic calls to any library that has GI annotations
installed...With it you can also write the performance-intensive parts
of your applications in Vala and call them from Node.js and other
languages."

## 6.5.3. Lua

[LGI](https://github.com/pavouk/lgi) provides runtime bindings for Lua
5.1+ and LuaJIT2. It uses libgirepository to read typelib files.

There are alternative binding generators: lgob and LuiGI.
[lgob](https://bitbucket.org/lucashnegri/lgob/src/master/) parses GIR
files to generate Lua modules. LuiGI was an experimental dynamic binding
generator. LGI should be used instead of LuiGI.

-   [LGI](https://github.com/pavouk/lgi) - "LGI is
    gobject-introspection based dynamic Lua binding to GObject based
    libraries...LGI is tested and compatible with standard Lua 5.1, Lua
    5.2, Lua 5.3 and LuaJIT2."
-   [lgob](https://bitbucket.org/lucashnegri/lgob/src/master/) - "lgob
    provides bindings of GObject-based libraries (like GTK+ and
    WebKitGTK+), for Lua 5.1 / 5.2 / LuaJIT. It consists of a compiler
    that parses GObject-Instrospection gir files and generates Lua
    modules. lgob ships with bindings for GTK+, pango, cairo, vte,
    WebKitGtk, GtkTextView, and others"
-   [Some thoughts (and code) around GObject-Introspection](https://perezdecastro.org/2010/some-thoughts-and-code-around-gobject-introspection.html)-
    blog post from 2010 about the origins of LuiGI, "the kind people
    there made me note about LGI, which is also a dynamic GI binding for
    Lua...but looking at its code I can tell that it is more complete
    than my own, so I will be probably contributing to it instead of
    duplicating efforts"

## 6.5.4. Perl

[perl-Glib-Object-Introspection](https://git.gnome.org/browse/perl-Glib-Object-Introspection/)
creates Perl bindings at runtime from a typelib file.

-   [Glib::Object::Introspection](http://search.cpan.org/~xaoc/Glib-Object-Introspection/lib/Glib/Object/Introspection.pm) -
    CPAN module of
    [perl-Glib-Object-Introspection](https://git.gnome.org/browse/perl-Glib-Object-Introspection/).
    The CPAN page includes examples.

## 6.5.5. Python

[PyGObject](https://pygobject.gnome.org/) is a Python package providing
bindings using GObject introspection.

-   [PyGObject Documentation](https://pygobject.gnome.org/) -
    "PyGObject provides full support of GObject Introspection and all
    of its features (callbacks, GVariant support, closures,
    sub-classing, etc.)"
-   [PyGObject source repository at GNOME GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pygobject/)
-   [pgi-docgen](https://github.com/pygobject/pgi-docgen) - GitHub
    repository of the API Documentation Generator for PyGObject
-   [PyGObject API Reference](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/) -
    pre-built API documentation for numerous libraries available through
    PyGObject

## 6.5.6. Rust

The [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/) project has developed the `gir` tool
to generate Rust bindings from a GIR file.

-   [gtk-rs/gir](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir) - GitHub repository for
    the `gir` tool. A GIR file is needed and an additional TOML file is
    used to pass binding metadata to the tool
