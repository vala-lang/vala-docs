# 7.1. valac

`valac` is the Vala compiler. Its primary function is to transform
Vala code into compilable C code.

You can generally ignore warnings from the C compiler when using Vala
and just need to notice the warnings from `valac` Vala has better
information than the C compiler, so it knows certain things are valid
when the C compiler has no way of knowing that.

Unfortunately we can't just add casts everywhere since there are
situations where we can't generate a valid cast (and, what's more, no
way to know what those situations are).

For example, compiling the
[Hello World program](../01-00-first-program) will give us some warnings because `valac` by default
generates code which is compatible with older versions of the
`GLib`.Some methods may have been deprecated in your new version of GLib
so that C language compiler will warn you.

Imagine a machine with older glib version want to run your vala program!

valac could generate C code with target GLib version:

```shell
valac --target-glib auto hello.vala # It will use the latest version of GLib which may not be compatible
```

The recommended approach is to just disable those warnings by passing
options to the C compiler:

```shell
valac -X -w hello.vala # Generated code is compatible, -X will pass -w to C compiler to disable all warnings.
```

You could set an alias in your bash/zsh/fish shell.

valac can also automate the entire build and link project in simple
cases:

```shell
valac -o appname --pkg gee-1.0 file_name_1.vala file_name_2.vala
```

The `-o` switch requests that an object file is created, rather than
just outputting C source files. The `--pkg` option says that this build
needs information from the *gee-1.0* package. You do not need to specify
details about what libraries to link in, the package has this
information internally. Finally, a list of source files is given. If you
need a more complicated build process, use the `-C` switch to generate C
files instead of a binary, and continue the process manually, or through
a script.
