Enums and Flags
===============

While C has support for enums, C programmers often do not use enums, opting instead for #defines. Both of these structures can be bound to Vala enums.

This first example is a straight mapping between a C enum and a Vala enum. The C:

.. code-block:: c

   typedef enum {
       FOO_A,
       FOO_B,
       FOO_C,
   } foo_e;


and the Vala binding:

.. code-block:: vala

   [CCode (cname = "foo_e", cprefix = "FOO_", has_type_id = false)]
   public enum Foo {
       A,
       B,
       C
   }

Note how ``cprefix`` is used in the above example to prepend ``FOO_`` to all the Vala values when the C is generated.

The second example shows how a series of definitions of constants in C can be mapped to a Vala enum:

.. code-block:: c

   #define BAR_X 1
   #define BAR_Y 2
   #define BAR_Z 3

.. code-block:: vala

   [CCode (cname = "int", cprefix = "BAR_", has_type_id = false)]
   public enum Bar {
       X,
       Y,
       Z
   }

Check where the ``enum`` is used to determine the correct type, though ``int`` and ``unsigned int`` are the most common.

There is also a common tendency to use combinable bit patterns. These are convertible to Vala flags enums.

.. code-block:: c

   #define FOO_READ (1<<0)
   #define FOO_WRITE (1<<1)
   #define FOO_CREATE (1<<2)

.. code-block:: vala

   [CCode (cname = "int", cprefix = "FOO_", has_type_id = false)]
   [Flags]
   public enum Foo {
       READ,
       WRITE,
       CREATE
   }

In Vala, enums and flags may have member functions. In particular, ``strerr``-like functions are best converted to member functions.
