A topic that can easily make anyone‚Äôs mind wobble. Here I try to make
them stick in to your mind (and maybe mine) by explaining them in the
simplest way possible.

üöÄ Introduction
----------------

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; **guidelines on how
to tackle certain problems**. They are not classes, packages or
libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic
to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain
problems in certain situations.

Wikipedia describes them as

   In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general
   reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given
   context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be
   transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description
   or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many
   different situations.

‚ö†Ô∏è Be Careful
-------------

-  Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
-  Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done
   so. Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions **to** problems,
   not solutions **finding** problems; so don‚Äôt overthink.
-  If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be
   a savior; or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.

   Also note that the code samples below are in Vala, however this
   shouldn‚Äôt stop you because the concepts are same anyways. Plus the
   **support for other languages is underway**.
