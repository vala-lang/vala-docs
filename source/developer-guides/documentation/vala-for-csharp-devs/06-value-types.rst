Value Types
===========

* sizes of standard types (``int``, ``long``, ...) are architecture dependent
* additional Vala types ``int8``, ``int16``, ``int32``, ``int64`` (signed),
  ``uint8``, ``uint16``, ``uint32``, ``uint64`` (unsigned) with architecture
  independent guaranteed sizes
* no ``byte``, ``sbyte`` (use ``uint8``, ``int8`` instead)
* no ``decimal``
* C# ``char`` is UCS-2, not Vala's ``char``, but similar to Vala's UCS-4 ``unichar``
