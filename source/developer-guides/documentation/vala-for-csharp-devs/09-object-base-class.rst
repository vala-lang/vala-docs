Object Base Class
=================

C#: implicit inheritance from ``object`` (System.Object)

.. code-block:: csharp

   class Foo
   {
       // ...
   }

Vala: no implicit inheritance from ``Object`` (GLib.Object)

.. code-block:: vala

   class Foo : Object {
       // ...
   }

What happens if you don't inherit from ``Object``? Nothing terrible. These
classes will be slightly more lightweight, however, they will lack some features
such as property change notifications, and your objects won't have a common base
class. Usually inheriting from ``Object`` is what you want.
