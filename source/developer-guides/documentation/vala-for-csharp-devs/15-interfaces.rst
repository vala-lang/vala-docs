Interfaces
==========

C#

.. code-block:: csharp

   interface IFoo
   {
       void Foo(int i);
       int Bar(string s, double d);
   }

Vala: ``public abstract`` necessary

.. code-block:: vala

   interface Foo {
       public abstract void foo (int i);
       public abstract int bar (string s, double d);
   }

Why? Because Vala interfaces may have non-abstract methods (i.e. methods with
implementations) and ``private`` methods! This means Vala interfaces can be used
as `mixins <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin>`_ (restricted form of multiple
inheritance).

'I'-prefix not common in GObject world but allowed

C#: interface inheritance

.. code-block:: csharp

   interface IfaceA
   {
       void MethodA();
   }

   interface IfaceB : IfaceA
   {
       void MethodB();
   }

   class Demo : IfaceB
   {
       public void MethodA() { }
       public void MethodB() { }
   }

Vala: interface prerequisites

.. code-block:: vala

   interface IfaceA : Object {
       public abstract void method_a ();
   }

   interface IfaceB : Object, IfaceA {
       public abstract void method_b ();
   }

   class Demo : Object, IfaceA, IfaceB {
       public void method_a () { }
       public void method_b () { }
   }

Interfaces in Vala may not inherit from other interfaces, but they may declare
other interfaces to be prerequisites, which works in roughly the same way.
Interfaces may also have a class as a prerequisite. This is often used to ensure
that an instance of an interface is also an ``Object`` subclass. The fact that
interfaces can not inherit from other interfaces is mostly only a technical
distinction - in practice Vala's system works the same as C# in this area, but
with the extra feature of prerequsite classes.
