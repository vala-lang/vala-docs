Static Constructors
===================

C#: called before the first instance is created or any static members are
referenced

.. code-block:: csharp

   class Foo
   {
       static Foo()
       {
           System.Console.WriteLine("Static constructor invoked.");
       }
   }

Vala: ``static construct { }`` block. The first time that a class, or any
subclass of it, is instantiated, this code is run. It is guaranteed that this
code will run exactly once in a program where such a class is used.

.. code-block:: vala

   class Foo : Object {
       static construct {
           stdout.printf ("Static constructor invoked.\n");
       }
   }

Additionally a Vala class can have a class construct { } block. This block will
be executed once at the first use of its class, and once at the first use of
each subclass of this class.
