Valadoc Guide
=============

``valadoc`` is a command line tool that generates Vala programming documentation from a library's API (Application Programming Interface).

The library's API can be :doc:`written manually </developer-guides/bindings/writing-a-vapi-manually>` in a VAPI file or :doc:`generated automatically </developer-guides/bindings/generating-a-vapi-with-gobject-introspection>` from source files and held in a GIR (GObject Introspection Repository) file. valadoc can generate documentation from both a VAPI file or a GIR file.

If the library is written in Vala then valadoc can generate the documentation from the library's Vala source files.
