Comments
========

Vala allows comments in code in different ways.

.. code-block:: vala

   // Comment continues until end of line

   /* Comment lasts between delimiters */

   /**
    * Documentation comment
    */


These are handled in the same way as in most other languages and so need little explanation.  Documentation comments are actually not special to Vala, but a documentation generation tool like :doc:`Valadoc </developer-guides/valadoc>` will recognise them.
